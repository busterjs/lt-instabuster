* Todo [0/2]
** TODO Set stackFilter on reporter
** TODO Set reporter verbosity
* Common logic
** Configure
*** Node: Capture console
*** Browser: startSession
*** Browser: Listen for uncaught exceptions
*** Browser: Attach reporter
** Before run hook
*** config.runExtensionHook("beforeRun")
*** Node: Read cached manifest, if any
*** Node: Process load:{libs,sources,tests,testHelpers} with manifest
** Resolve configuration (ordering important, beforeRunHook must add processors first)
** When runHook and config resolved: run tests
** Write manifests
** Initialize runner
** runExtensionHook("testRun")
   **
* Multi-runner
** Emit suite:start
** On downstream suite:start, emit "environment:start" { name: String }
** All test-runner events must include { environment: "NAME" }
** Proxy events
** On downstream suite:end, emit "environment:end"
** When all runners have suite:end-ed, aggregate results and emit suite:end
